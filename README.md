# Decision Tree Classifier Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `notebooks/decision_tree_iris.ipynb` to view the implementation

## Dataset
This project uses the Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target variable (species).

## Implementation Details
The notebook includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model training with Decision Tree
- Model visualization
- Performance evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- graphviz
- jupyter
